Cornerstone
===========

Web framework built on node.js.

This node framework will be a production-ready node.js framework that takes full (as much as we can) advantage of EcmaScript 6 by making use of [Google Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).  It is built on top of [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) at its core, and also uses [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) for many of the internal APIs.
